    bio: `Margaux Sauvé and Louis-Étienne Santais of Ghostly Kisses understand the allure of a secret. The hum and hiss of its magnetism. The unimaginable joy of being a conduit for openness. We all want to feel intimacy, the pull of our heart, growing and learning together. So Ghostly Kisses set out on a seemingly impossible journey to collect anonymous stories and letters from fans around the world through their “Box of Secrets” posted to the band’s website. Sauvé and her partner Santais synthesized those missives into the mesmeric Darkroom (due May 17th via Akira Records), a record that wills our inner monologue into view, tears falling on the dancefloor only to find mystic connection in the darkest electronic corners. Darkroom illuminates the gossamer threads connecting fans around the world, weaving anonymity into a microcosm of comfort, and a safe space for reinvention for the Quebec City-based band.`,
